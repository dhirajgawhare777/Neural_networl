Project Overview:

This project focuses on creating, evaluating, and analyzing a neural network model designed to classify sonar signals as either rocks or mines. Utilizing the TensorFlow framework, the model's architecture and hyperparameters are established to achieve effective classification accuracy.

Dataset Description:
The dataset comprises two key files:

sonar.mines: Contains 111 patterns gathered from metal cylinders.
sonar.rocks: Holds 97 patterns collected from rocks.
Each pattern encompasses 60 numerical values representing energy levels within distinct frequency bands. These values stem from frequency-modulated chirp sonar signals. Labels ("R" for rock and "M" for mine) are attached to each pattern to denote its classification.
Neural Network Architecture:
The neural network structure encompasses:

Input Layer: Comprising 60 neurons, correlating with the feature count.
Hidden Layers: Four hidden layers, each comprising 60 neurons and employing varying activation functions like RELU and sigmoid.
Output Layer: With two neurons denoting rock ("R") and mine ("M") classifications.
Hyperparameter Configuration:
To ensure effective model training, the following hyperparameters are configured:

Learning Rate: 0.2
Epochs: 500
Hidden Layers: 4
Neurons per Hidden Layer: 60
Batch Size: Full-batch training
Training and Assessment:
The training process utilizes TensorFlow's Gradient Descent optimizer. The model's performance is monitored by tracking cross-entropy loss (cost) and accuracy throughout epochs. Model evaluation occurs on an independent test set. Mean Squared Error (MSE) is computed to gauge prediction precision.

Project Outcomes:

Cost Trend: The cost consistently diminishes across epochs, indicating convergence.
Test Accuracy: This metric reflects the model's effectiveness in classifying sonar signals.
MSE Calculation: MSE serves as a quantitative measure of prediction accuracy.
